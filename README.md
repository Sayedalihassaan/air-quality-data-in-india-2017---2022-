# Air Quality Data Analysis in India (2017 - 2022)

This project aims to analyze air quality data collected from various locations across India from 2017 to 2022. The primary focus is on applying regression machine learning techniques to predict air quality parameters based on various factors such as location, time of the year, meteorological conditions, and other relevant variables.

## Introduction

Air pollution is a significant environmental concern globally, with India being one of the most affected countries. Understanding the trends and factors influencing air quality is crucial for implementing effective policies and interventions to mitigate pollution levels. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze air quality data collected over a span of six years in India.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical air quality data collected from various monitoring stations across India. It includes measurements of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, etc., along with meteorological parameters and geographical information. The dataset is sourced from [provide source if available].

## Methodology

The methodology involves several steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to understand distributions, correlations, and trends.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant features for regression modeling.
4. Model Selection: Evaluating various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc., and selecting the best-performing model based on metrics like RMSE, R-squared, etc.
5. Model Training and Evaluation: Training the selected model on the training dataset and evaluating its performance on the test dataset.
6. Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the model for better performance.
7. Prediction: Making predictions on unseen data to forecast air quality parameters.

## Usage

To use this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to execute different stages of the analysis.
4. Follow the instructions provided within the notebooks/scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be summarized in terms of model performance metrics, insights gained from the data, and potential implications for air quality management in India. Visualizations and summary statistics will also be provided to aid in interpreting the findings.
